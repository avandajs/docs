# Avanda CLI

Get started with **core fundamentals** of Avandajs. To get familiar with the essential building blocks of an Avanda application, we'll breakdown the installation to each Avanda Components

### Language

We're in love with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), but above all - we love [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), utilizing [esno](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esno) to compile in ms. Avanda takes advantage of the latest typescript features and enables custom typing for your application which makes it less prone to errors.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >= 16) is installed on your operating system.

### Setup

Setting up a new project is quite simple with the [Avanda CLI](/components/cli/overview).
::CodeGroup{toggleText="npm,yarn"}
#npm

```bash
$ npm install @avanda/cli -g
```

#yarn

```bash
$ yarn global add @avanda/cli
```

::

### Create a new Project

With [Avanda CLI](/components/cli/overview) installed, you can create a new Avanda project with the following commands in your OS terminal:

```bash
$ avanda init <project-name>
$ cd <project-name>
$ npm install
```

> **Note:** To create a new project Avanda CLI must be installed.

The `project-name` directory will be created, and boilerplate files will be installed, and a `app/` directory will be created and populated with several core files for you to get started with.

Here's a brief overview of those core files:

| Directories/file | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| app              | Core folders for you to work with includes: the controllers, middleware, models, seeders...       |
| build            | This directory contains all [build](/guide/buid) files created when you build your avanda project |
| configs          | This directory contains the files you need to configure your database and server                  |
| .env             | This contains all your environment variables                                                      |

The `avanda.ts` includes an async function, which will **boot** our application:

```typescript [avanda.ts]
import Avanda from "@avanda/cli";
import Models from "./app/models/.boot";
import Seeders from "./app/seeders/.boot";
import Commands from "./app/commands/.boot";
import { Connection } from "@avanda/app";
import Config from "./configs/database";

async function boot() {
  return Avanda(Commands, Models, Seeders, await Connection(Config));
}

boot();
```

### Running the application

When installation of your app is complete, you can run the following command to install [esno](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esno) for easy compilation of your project.
::CodeGroup{toggleText="npm,yarn"}
#npm

```bash
$ npm i -g esno
```

#yarn

```bash
$ yarn global add esno
```

::
Once the installation process is complete, you can run the following command at your OS command prompt to start the application listening for inbound HTTP requests:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```
>This command will watch your files, automatically recompiling and reloading the server.

This command starts the app with the HTTP server listening on the port defined in the `.env` file. Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`. You should see the `Hello World!` message.
