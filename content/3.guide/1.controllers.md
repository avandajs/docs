# Controllers

Controllers are essential in an avanda project, they are functions used to communicate with HTTP requests and manage the activities of the database. Each Controller connects with its respective [models](/guide/models), making it easy for the controller to communicate with the database. Requests are made to the [controller functions](#controller-functions) with the [Avanda Json Graph Api](components/avanda-JSGA/overview)

## Create a Controller
It is best practice to make the name of the controller the same as the model you want the controller to connect to 
> A [Model](/guide/models) for the respective controller must exist before creating the controller

```bash
$ yarn avanda create controller -n <controller-name> 
```

## Controller functions
Functions to communicate with HTTP requests and database, the controller file created by avanda CLI connects the contoller to the respective database model which creates an instance of the model in the controller created

- ### Define a controller function
For every controller function a request type of either a `Get()` or `Post()` request must be specified, which accepts [middlewares](/guide/middlewares) as arguments, then define the function as an asynchronous function 

```ts
import {Controller, Request, Response, Get} from "@avanda/http";
import modelName from "../models/modelName"

export default class ControllerName extends Controller {
    model?:  modelName
    /*
    function getAllData with request type of GET which
    gets all the data from the connected model
     */
    @Get() // request type 
    async getAllData(res: Response,req: Request) {
        return res.alldata()
    }
}
```
In the function `getAllData` above, request type defined is a `GET` request which may accept middleware. The code in the function makes request to the current controller model to get all the data available in the database, then returns the data back to client
